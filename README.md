Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!




Rules of the Game

Each player (you and the computer, in this case) chooses one of the five options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The winner is determined by the rules below, which explain what beats what:

Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard.

Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard.

Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.

Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper.

Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.

The game aims to select a choice that defeats the opponent's choice based on these rules.

How to Play

Start the Game: When you load the game in your browser, you'll see buttons for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock.

Make Your Choice: Click on one of the buttons to make your choice.

Computer's Choice: After you make your choice, the computer randomly selects its choice from the five options.

Determine the Winner: The game then compares the choices based on the rules mentioned above to determine the winner of that round.

Score and Attempts: The game updates the scores and attempts left. You start with a limited number of attempts, and each choice you make uses one attempt.

Game Over: The game ends when you run out of attempts. The final score will indicate how many rounds you won against the computer.

Strategy

While the game is based on chance, playing multiple rounds can help you notice patterns in the computer's choices (if any are programmed) or adjust your choices to try and outguess your opponent, though in a truly random selection, strategy comes down to chance.

In a more complex version of the game, pattern recognition could be implemented to make the computer's choices more challenging by adapting to the player's selection habits, increasing the game's difficulty as you play more rounds.
